#Securely stream data from ESP8266 MCUs to Azure IoT Hub over HTTPS/REST

###Purpose

This solution securely streams sensor data directly to 
[Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/iot-hub-what-is-iot-hub/) 
or [Azure Event Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/) over HTTPS calling Azure REST APIs from ESP8266 MCUs.


###Device Platform


The [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) is a great commodity priced [Arduino](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) 
compatible MCU with integrated WiFi. 

This project is implemented and tested on the following ESP8266 based development boards:-

1. [NodeMCU V2 (also known as V1.0)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU), 
2. [WeMos D1 Mini](http://www.wemos.cc/wiki/doku.php?id=en:d1_mini) 
3. and [SparkFun ESP8266 Thing](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13711)

###Firmware

[Arduino core for ESP8266 WiFi chip V2.0](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) firmware adds HTTPS ([TLS](http://axtls.sourceforge.net/) 1.0 and 1.1) support, making this a viable platform for secure IoT data streaming. See [Security Discussion](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/43) for more information.




###Azure IoT Hub and Azure Event Hub

IoT Hub is designed to "Connect, monitor, and control millions of IoT assets", Azure Event Hubs is 
designed for internet scale data ingestion. 

[Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/stream-analytics/), 
[Power Bi](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) and preconfigured IoT Hub solutions such as 
[Remote monitoring ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/iot-suite-remote-monitoring-sample-walkthrough) provide ways to visualise and unlock the value of your data in Azure.

For more background information read this "[Stream Analytics & Power BI: A real-time analytics dashboard for streaming data](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/stream-analytics-power-bi-dashboard/)" article.

#Setup and Deployment Summary

1. Setup your Azure IoT Hub. There is a free 8000 message a day subscription to get started.
2. Register your device with Azure IoT Hub.
3. Flash Azure and Network configuration information to EEPROM
4. Update the main AzureClient.ino sketch
5. Deploy the solution to your ESP8266 based device.
6. View data with Device Explorer
7. Optionally: Visualise your data in real time with Azure Stream Analytics and Power BI.


#Setting Up Azure IoT Hub

Follow lab [Setting Up Azure IoT](http://thinglabs.io/workshop/cs/nightlight/setup-azure-iot-hub/) to provision an Azure IoT Hub and an IoT Hub device. 



#Azure Configuration

Right mouse click the device you setup in Device Explorer to obtain device id, key and connection string information.

The function initCloudConfig() called from the setup() function in AzureClient.ino has two signatures. 


  
    // Inline cloud and network configuration information
    
    initCloudConfig("IoT hub device connection string", "Case Sensitive WiFi SSID", "WiFi password", "Geo location of the device"). 
   
    Example:
    
    initCloudConfig("HostName=YourIoTHub.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=YourDeviceId;SharedAccessKey=YourDeviceKey", "SSID", "Password", "Sydney");
    
    or 
    
    //To read cloud and network configuration from EEPROM. This is useful if deploying multiple devices
    
    initCloudConfig(); 
    


##Optional EEPROM Configuration

You can burn cloud and network configuration information to the device EEPROM.  To configure the EEPROM open the SetEEPROMConfiguration.ino found in the SetEEPROMConfiguration folder and update the following variables:-

  - Wi-Fi SSID and password pairs, put in priority order.
  - Wifi - Is the number of WiFi ssid and password pairs
  - Azure IoT Hub or Event Bus Host name eg "MakerDen.azure-devices.net", Device ID, and Key. For IoT Hub get this information from the Device Explorer, for Event Hub, get from Azure Management Portal.
  - Geo location of the device
  
Upload this sketch to the device to write configuration settings to EEPROM.

**Be sure to call function initCloudConfig() with no parameters to ensure Azure and Network parameters are read from EEPROM.**


Next upload the AzureClient sketch which will 
read this configuration information from the EEPROM. 





#Device Configuration 

You need to configure the initDeviceConfig() function in the AzureClient.ino file.


    void initDeviceConfig() {  // Example device configuration
        device.boardType = Other;            // BoardType enumeration: NodeMCU, WeMos, SparkfunThing, Other (defaults to Other). This determines pin number of the onboard LED for wifi and publish status. Other means no LED status 
        device.deepSleepSeconds = 0;         // if greater than zero with call ESP8266 deep sleep (default is 0 disabled). GPIO16 needs to be tied to RST to wake from deepSleep. Causes a reset, execution restarts from beginning of sketch
        cloud.cloudMode = IoTHub;            // CloudMode enumeration: IoTHub and EventHub (default is IoTHub)
        cloud.publishRateInSeconds = 90;     // limits publishing rate to specified seconds (default is 90 seconds)
        cloud.sasExpiryDate = 1737504000;    // Expires Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT (defaults to Expires Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT)
    }

Then upload the sketch to your device.

#Visualising Data

##Azure Stream Analytics

[Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/stream-analytics/) enables you to gain 
real-time insights in to your device, sensor, infrastructure, and application data.

See the [Visualizing IoT Data](http://thinglabs.io/workshop/cs/nightlight/visualize-iot-with-powerbi/) lab.  Replace the query in that lab with the following and be sure to change the time zone to your local time zone offset.  Australia (AEDST) is currently +11 hours.

    SELECT
        DateAdd(minute,-5,System.TimeStamp) AS WinStartTime, 
        System.TimeStamp AS WinEndTime, 
        DateAdd(Hour, 11, System.TIMESTAMP) AS AUTimezone,
        Dev AS [DeviceId],
        AVG(Celsius) AS [Celsius], 
        AVG(hPa) AS [hPa],
        AVG(Humidity) AS [Humidity]        
    INTO [OutputPBI]
    FROM [Input]  TIMESTAMP BY UTC
    GROUP BY Dev, TumblingWindow (mi, 10)

#Software Requirements

##Drivers

1. NodeMCU - On Windows, Mac and Linux you will need to install the latest [CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx).
2. WeMos - On Windows and Mac install the latest [Ch340G drivers](http://www.wemos.cc/wiki/doku.php?id=en:ch340g). No drivers required for Linux.
3. [ESP8266 Thing Development Board Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp8266-thing-development-board-hookup-guide/hardware-setup)


##Arduino IDE

1. [Arduino IDE 1.6.5](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) As at Dec, 2015, [Arduino 1.6.6 has several issues, so to stick with 1.6.5](http://esp8266.github.io/Arduino/versions/2.0.0/doc/installing.html)
2. As at Dec 2015, ESP8266 Board Manager 2.0.0 or better required for HTTPS/TLS Secure Client support.

##Visual Studio

There an fantastic plugin for Visual Studio that adds Arduino support from [Visual Micro](http://www.visualmicro.com/).  IntelliSence, auto complete, debugging, it doesn't get much better:)

##Arduino Boards Manager ESP8266 Support

Starting with 1.6.4, Arduino allows installation of third-party platform packages using Boards Manager.

1. Install Arduino 1.6.5 from the Arduino website.
2. Start Arduino and open Preferences window.
3. Enter  http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json  into Additional Board Manager URLs field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
4. Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and install esp8266 platform (and don't forget to select your ESP8266 board from Tools > Board menu after installation).
5. Select NodeMCU or WeMos D1 Mini Board: Tools -> Board -> NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E module) or WeMos D1 Mini
6. Set Port and Upload Speed: Tools.  Note, you may need to try different port speeds to successfully flash the device. Faster is better as each time you upload the code to your device you are re-flashing the complete ROM not just your code.
